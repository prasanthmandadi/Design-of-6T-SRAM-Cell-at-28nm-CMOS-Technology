Memories are the crucial blocks in VLSI system design. The performance, power, and area of memories should be carefully inspected before fabrication of the system. In digital processors, we use SRAM cells in the memory cache for faster performance and low power consumption. 6T SRAM cell is designed with Synopsys Design Compiler using 28nm CMOS technology
