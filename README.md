**Literature Survey**
The number of transistors on an IC becomes twice 
every 18 months, according to Moore's law. For the modern 
System on Chip (SoC) technology, design is essential for
memory circuits with high performance. The critical duty of 
memory is storing data and accessing stored data for reading 
or writing as per demand. Non-volatile memory and volatile 
memory are primary differentiation of memory. When there 
is no power supply, stored data will be lost in volatile memory 
like RAM (Random Access Memory). Static RAM (SRAM) 
and Dynamic RAM (DRAM) are furthermore differentiation 
of RAM. In microprocessors and cache memories, SRAMs 
are widely used. The reason for using SRAM memories is 
that they have a minor power dissipation nature. SRAM's
speed of operation is high. The CMOS IC technology entered
the nanometer regime by scaling size continuously. The 
performance will be improved by decreasing the size of bulk-CMOS as we change to new technology. In modern SOCs,
SRAM has mainly used memory since it can hold data till 
there is a power supply to the cell. SRAM has two cross-coupled inverters. It can perform read and write operations 
without any update even though it occupies more space on 
the chip. In storing a single bit of data using a flip-flop, the 
SRAM cell is beneficial. SRAMs are mainly used as memory 
caches. For high performance and reliability, SRAM cells are 
used. The microprocessor uses SRAMs since it can go 
beyond the speeds of 250MHz. The density of SRAM cells is 
more when compared to DRAM cells. Though meticulously 
designed SRAMs are comparatively a little bit high in cost, 
functionality is cost-effective.
